fix: carousel molecule, it is still derived from game list. Note behavior is working on it.
in game list organism remove comments, check if you can handle touch scrolling for it. Also check a way to handle or separate behavior into another file
fix: sometime vite/tailwind dont compile classes with dynamic values, add fallback css for needed components
images not working when serving production
improve accordion component by moving taiwindcss and use interface on its params
clean up gametile.css
move movable game list clasess to tailwind css directive
change let to const in component declaration
add carousel for game list
